# 03 Unrecognized dangers

British Airways Flight 009 was a flight from London Heathrow Airport to Auckland International Airport in New Zealand, passing through Mumbai, Chennai, Kuala Lumpur, Perth and Melbourne.

On June 24, 1982, the flight was operated by a Boeing 747-200. While flying over the airspace near Indonesia, the aircraft entered a volcanic ash cloud, causing all four engines to stall. The crew successfully restarted the engines after the aircraft skidded out of the volcanic ash cloud , and made an emergency landing at Halim Perdanakusuma International Airport in Jakarta. Passengers and crew were all safe .



At the time, the dangers of volcanic ash clouds were not fully recognized. Weather radar on airplanes is used to detect moisture in clouds, and volcanic ash clouds are dry, so they do not appear on weather radar. Volcanic ash in the cloud prevented the engines from getting enough oxygen from the atmosphere to sustain combustion, and the windshields and landing light covers were sandblasted and the engines clogged. When volcanic ash enters an engine, it melts in the combustion chamber and sticks to the interior of the power plant. As the engine cools from rest and the aircraft descends from the ash cloud, the molten ash solidifies, and when enough ash falls off, air flows smoothly through the engine again, allowing a successful restart. This is the technical reason why the aircraft engine was shut down and restarted in this case.

无独有偶， 19 天后的 7 月 13 日，一架新加坡航空公司的747 客机在飞过同一地区时三台发动机熄火，印尼当局永久关闭了该空域，并重新安排航线避开该地区。当局也设立了监视站来监测火山灰云。Coincidentally, 19 days later on July 13, three engines of a Singapore Airlines 747 stalled while flying over the same area. Indonesian authorities permanently closed the airspace and rerouted the route to avoid the area. Authorities also set up monitoring stations to monitor the ash cloud.

The impact of volcanic ash clouds on flight safety has not been fully understood before and has not attracted enough attention. Now, if a volcanic ash cloud is encountered during flight operations, the flight crew must first fly and manage the aircraft systems in accordance with emergency flight procedures approved by the civil aviation authority and the aircraft manufacturer's manual. This is what this article hopes to point out. There are always new phenomena, new problems, and new understandings. Only through a method system of continuous learning, improvement, innovation, and evaluation can organizations continue to achieve safety performance.
