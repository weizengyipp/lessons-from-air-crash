# 11 Geopolitics Risks

Iran Air Flight 655, a scheduled passenger flight from Tehran to Dubai via Bandar Abbas Port, was shot down by two surface-to-air missiles fired by the USS Vincennes on July 3, 1988. The Airbus A300 aircraft hit by the missile was flying over Iranian territorial waters in the Persian Gulf at the time, killing all 290 people on board. The shooting down occurred during the Iran-Iraq war, which has been going on for nearly eight years.

The U.S. government later claimed that it misidentified the civilian aircraft as an F-14 Tomcat fighter jet performing an attack mission. The Iranian government believes that the USS Vincennes deliberately shot down the Iranian passenger plane with full knowledge and tacit approval of the Pentagon.

The cases listed in this article are intended to remind us that in a world that has not undergone major changes in a century, the world pattern is undergoing profound changes, geopolitical frictions and conflicts continue, and geopolitics and armed conflicts should be included in risk management.
