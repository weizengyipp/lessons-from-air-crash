# 05 Incorrect fuel unit conversion

Air Canada Flight 143 was a flight from Montreal, Quebec to Edmonton, Alberta via Ottawa, Ontario.

On July 23, 1983, a Boeing 767 passenger aircraft that had just been delivered about 4 months ago was flying this flight from Ottawa to Edmonton while cruising at a flight altitude of 41,000 feet (12,500 meters). Both engines ran out of fuel and lost power. Fortunately, the passenger plane finally glided and landed at an abandoned air base.



The direct cause of the accident was human error when converting metric units to imperial units, which resulted in an incorrect calculation of the amount of fuel added. The aircraft had only half of the available fuel when performing its flight mission. The accident occurred due to a series of problems:



First, before takeoff, the maintenance personnel discovered that the sensor of the fuel level indicator was malfunctioning and could not display the fuel level. They wanted to replace the fuel indicator, but because the aircraft was one of the first batch (four) of Air Canada's 767 aircraft at that time,  they didnâ€™t have many 767 parts, so they had to give up.

Secondly, after the captain learned about this problem before takeoff, he learned by consulting the Minimum Equipment List (MEL) that the 767 aircraft could not take off without a fuel display. However, the captain believed that as long as the fuel was calculated manuall, whitch allows the aircraft to fly safely. The captain decided to replenish fuel and continue the flight.



Third, traditional civil aviation aircraft calculate the weight of fuel in British pounds (the takeoff and landing of an aircraft is very sensitive to load, so weight rather than volume is used to calculate fuel). This batch of Boeing 767-233 passenger aircraft that have just been put into service uses the metric unit liter. The ground crew converted the metric volume in liters to the imperial weight in pounds and got the conversion factor wrong. As a result, 20,088 liters of fuel should have been added, but only 4,916 liters were added by mistake.



Finally, in the past, the calculation of fuel replenishment was always the responsibility of flight engineers, but the Boeing 767 was one of the few new aircraft models at that time to adopt a two-person piloting arrangement, so the pilots were instead responsible for this work item with which they were unfamiliar. When the ground staff brought the refueling records to the captain for verification, he checked the relevant calculation data, but still misused the wrong conversion factor and did not notice the problem.



Through the above series of issues, it is not difficult to see that Air Canada did not do the required work for the newly introduced Boeing 767 aircraft at all, and failed to provide the crew with sufficient training to familiarize themselves with the operation process of the new aircraft. Company management is responsible for the accident. This is what this case wants to specifically point out. When organizations introduce and apply new resources, they should be well prepared. In particular, they need to fully assess the changes and impact of new resources on the work of various departments and make corresponding adjustments.
