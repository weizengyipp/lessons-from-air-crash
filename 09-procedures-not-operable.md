On November 28, 1987, a Boeing 747-244BM mixed passenger and cargo (Combi B-class cargo cabin) flight was operated. When the flight was over the Indian Ocean, 250 kilometers southeast of Mauritius, the main cargo compartment caught fire and crashed, killing all 159 people on board. It was the second deadliest in 1987 and the deadliest air crash since the establishment of South African Airways.



When the fire broke out, the flight attendant tried to put out the fire with a fire extinguisher, but the fire was too large and the temperature in the cabin was too high to put out the fire. Since the fire continued to produce toxic smoke, the pilot had to open the cargo door to clear the smoke. Shortly after the pilot made an emergency call to Mauritius air traffic control to request a lower altitude, the plane lost contact with air traffic control and then crashed into the sea.



Since the wreckage of the plane sank in the deep sea, rescue was extremely difficult. It took a full year after the accident for the wreckage and black box of the crashed airliner to be found and salvaged. However, most of the contents of the tape were unrecognizable due to being soaked in the sea for a long time. It is also suspected that the fire destroyed the circuit. The recorder was lost before the plane crashed. Stopped working and no key content was recorded. The cause of the fire is still unknown. After the accident, South African Airways immediately grounded all of its Boeing 747 passenger and cargo aircraft.

The first focus of this case is the fire protection design of the Boeing 747 passenger and cargo hybrid.



According to the design operation, when a fire breaks out in the main cargo compartment, the crew is allowed to directly enter the cargo compartment to put out the fire. However, judging from this case, when the temperature of the cabin is high and full of toxic smoke, it is completely unrealistic for the crew to manually put out the fire.



In our emergency response or other business operation procedures, whether the prescribed operating procedures can be implemented, and whether they are operable and effective. If the answer is no, then this is just self-deception on paper.



Whether the operating procedures can be implemented and whether they are effective requires simulating real situations for testing (or drills). This is also the second point of concern that this case wants to remind.



In this case, Boeing's test of the 747 passenger and cargo hybrid was as follows: a bundle of tobacco leaves was ignited in the cargo hold, and the fire was limited to the cargo hold. At this time, the pressure of the air in the passenger cabin is slightly higher than that of the cargo compartment, so the crew opens the cargo compartment door, and the air in the passenger cabin will flow into the cargo compartment, preventing smoke or gas from escaping from the door, and the crew can perform fire extinguishing operations.



In an experiment to investigate the accident, investigators designed the test like this: Adding plastic coverings and extra pallets provided fuel for the fire, which quickly spread and produced enough smoke to trigger smoke alarms. The larger flames heated The air in the cargo hold. The pressure of this heated air is higher than that in the passenger cabin. When the crew opens the door between the passenger cabin and the cargo hold, the smoke and gas can quickly flow into the passenger cabin and spread. Crews were unable to conduct firefighting operations.



Evidence from this test, as well as from the accident scene, demonstrates that the Class B cargo compartment used on the 747 Combi aircraft does not provide adequate fire protection.



The fire situation simulated by Boeing did not meet the real conditions, and the FAA believed that this model of 747 had certification defects.



Finally, the FAA issued a mandatory airworthiness directive requiring the Boeing 747 passenger and cargo hybrid to change the design, and issued new regulations in 1993 that stipulated that manual fire extinguishing by crew members entering the cargo hold should not be the main means of extinguishing fires in the main deck cargo hold. This resulted in The 747 Combi Class B cargo compartment was canceled as airworthy.
