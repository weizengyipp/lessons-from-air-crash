On June 12, 1972, a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 wide-body airliner was decompressing at high altitude while flying from Detroit to New York. The cargo door on the left rear of the fuselage fell off, resulting in incomplete control of the aircraft. Thanks to the efforts of the captain, the aircraft finally returned to Detroit safely.



The cause of the accident was a design flaw in the cargo door of the DC-10 passenger aircraft. The cargo door seemed to be locked, but there may not be a real lock inside. Moreover, the door display located in the cockpit, even though the door may not be locked, was clearly visible. However, the indicator light will turn off when the hatch is closed, making people mistakenly think that it is locked. If the door is closed improperly, the cargo door will explode and decompress during climb. After the accident, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board asked aircraft manufacturer McDonnell Douglas to modify the design and upgrade and repair existing aircraft.



On March 3, 1974, less than two years after the Flight 96 accident, Turkish Airlines Flight 981, operated by a McDonnell Douglas DC-10-10 wide-body aircraft, crashed outside Paris, killing all 346 passengers and crew on board. Killed by the same rear cargo door failure. After investigation, it was found that although McDonnell Douglas had some redesigns of the DC-10 cargo door system, it did not force the existing aircraft to undergo modifications and upgrades. It only left it to the airlines to implement it voluntarily, and the Turkish Airlines aircraft The aircraft has not been upgraded or maintained. Many commentators subsequently blamed aircraft manufacturer McDonnell Douglas and aviation authorities for failing to learn lessons from the Flight 96 accident and implement improvements.



Coincidentally, on September 8, 1989, Bernard Air Flight 394, flying from Norway to Germany, crashed in Hirtshals, 30 kilometers north of Denmark. All 50 passengers and five crew members on board died, making it the worst air crash involving Norwegian Air. The cause of the accident was that the aircraft manufacturer used inferior bolts with only 60% of the strength of standard parts when fixing the vertical tail. As a result, the bolts broke after 16 flights, causing the rudder to shake violently, causing the aircraft to tilt, flip, and crash.



What this case points out is that during our service process, we should increase the monitoring of third-party suppliers or service providers, including but not limited to daily service quality, alarm information, service upgrade information and operational risks; at the same time, we should establish third-party screening standard procedures.
