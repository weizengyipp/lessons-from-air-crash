# 02 Crew members were overly focused

United Airlines Flight 173 was a scheduled flight that took off from John F. Kennedy International Airport in New York, USA, stopped at Denver International Airport in Colorado, and headed to Portland International Airport in Oregon.

On December 28, 1978, the flight was operated by a McDonnell Douglas DC-8-61. When the flight was preparing to land, after the landing gear was lowered, only two of the three green lights representing the nose wheel and main landing gear came on. At this time, the captain gave up the landing and hovered in the air, thus gaining more time to find out the cause of the failure and prepare passengers for an emergency landing. The decision to abandon the landing was the right one.



However, while the captain and first officer were concentrating on checking and troubleshooting, they failed to properly monitor the aircraft's fuel status and detect the lack of fuel. The flight crashed an hour later due to exhaustion of fuel, killing 10 of the 189 people on board and seriously injuring 24 others.



Eastern Airlines Flight 401 was a scheduled flight from New York's JFK Airport to Miami. At midnight on December 29, 1972, the Lockheed L-1011-1 Tristar aircraft crashed into the Florida Everglades, killing 101 people. Three cockpit crew members, 2 of 10 flight attendants, and 96 of 163 passengers were killed; 75 survived.

The process of the crash was as follows: During the preparation stage for landing, the light indicating that the landing gear was down did not come on (it was later confirmed that it was just a light bulb that burned out), and the pilot could not determine whether the landing gear had been down. The entire crew was attracted by this problem. , and concentrated on troubleshooting the problem that the landing gear indicator light did not light up. Among them, the captain accidentally touched the joystick, causing the autopilot to shut down (Eastern Airlines pilots were not told during training that the autopilot would be deactivated by touching the joystick, leaving them unalert).



Since all crews were focused on fixing the landing gear and the plane was flying at night, the crew had no idea of ​​the plane's descending altitude and did not notice the altitude alarm. As a result, the plane gradually lost altitude and crashed. (The air traffic controller was the only person who discovered that the plane was descending. However, the radar altitude display at that time often had temporary errors, and aviation regulations at the time stated that air traffic controller was not responsible for maintaining the aircraft's altitude. Therefore, air traffic controller did not inform the aircraft that the aircraft was descending, nor did it ask, which is one of the reasons why the pilot did not notice the aircraft's altitude dropped).



What these two cases show is that in the face of system failures, problems or subtle changes may occur in team management and division of labor. This is what this case specifically reminds us. In an emergency, it is necessary to ensure:

* Good communication among different members
* Clear division of work
* Good leaders take sound advice
* Avoid making wrong decisions in critical situations



To ensure the above four points, we need to rely on standardized procedures and daily training. As an improvement, crew resource management was introduced in the civil aviation field and was later applied to other fields.
