# Preface

The high safety level of air transport is achieved after hundreds of years of hard work by the entire aviation industry.



Its proactive, coordinated, risk-based approach to continuous improvements in aviation safety is key to maintaining the position as the safest mode of transport.



The goal of this project document is to point out the factors that caused the accident from past aviation accident cases and draw experience for the organization to improve safety performance.



The research focus on accident elements has evolved from technology, individuals to organizations. In these cases, the accident elements will be seen:

* Force majeure: bad weather, flocks of birds
* Technology: limited technical level at the time, design defects, manufacturing defects, maintenance defects, and insufficient equipment
* Standardized procedures: lack of standardized procedures, failure to update procedures in a timely manner, unimplementable standardized procedures, unclear standardized procedures, and lack of implementation supervision and inspection
* Individual: lack of training, violation of standard procedures, poor execution, intentional crash, insufficient English language skills, insufficient language expression skills (unable to clearly describe the situation)
* Human resources: deviation in task completion, arrogance, communication barriers due to different cultural backgrounds, workplace culture that dares not challenge authority, lack of new division of labor required by new technologies
* Organizational management: chain reactions caused by cost reduction under industry competition, putting unfamiliar or unused new services/technologies into production and operation, market expansion goals exceeding organizational capabilities, unreasonable safety decisions by senior management, condoning or tolerating violations, and internal supervision missing
* External systems: national social unrest, terrorist attacks, geopolitical risks, irresponsible third parties, manufacturing decline, improper authorization or regulatory inaction caused by private transactions/interest exchanges

In most accidents, the accident element does not appear alone, and an accident chain composed of multiple factors is a common mode of accident occurrence.



Each accident case document contains a basic case overview and key accident elements. The content is independent and there is no context between documents. You can choose to read them in order, or you can read them based on an incident you care about.



In addition to accident cases, some safety management and technology, human factors challenges and coping methods are briefly introduced.



When we talk about production accidents and safety, words such as "preventing minor accidents", "obeying regulations", and "risk awareness" can easily become words that remain on paper, let alone boring scientific safety theories.



Case - this narrative description, the oldest behavioral pattern of mankind, is deeply embedded in human genes. By reading cases and becoming familiar with the formation and development of accident elements and accident chains, it will not only help you and your organization achieve the goal of effectively reducing the probability of accidents, but you can also feel the human spirit of striving to face problems objectively and the positive force for continuous improvement.
