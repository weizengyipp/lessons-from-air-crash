# 04 Lack of targeted preventive measures

Air Canada Flight 797 was a scheduled flight from Dallas, USA to Montreal, Canada, stopping in Toronto.

On June 2, 1983, while a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32 passenger aircraft was performing this flight, a fire broke out in the toilet of the aircraft and thick smoke filled the entire aircraft. Although the plane made an emergency landing in the end, a flash fire after landing prevented the 23 passengers on board from escaping. The source of the fire remains a mystery as the fire has severely destroyed much of the evidence.



The first concern in this case is the risk of fire. At that time, there were generally no preventive measures against aircraft fires. For example, smoking was allowed in the cabin, there were no smoke detectors installed on the aircraft, there were no emergency escape route instructions, and no fireproof materials were used.



Secondly, the flight attendants used fire extinguishers to try to extinguish the fireworks in the toilet. When they found that the smoke did not spread, they thought they had extinguished the fireworks, so they reported to the captain. The captain was afraid of missing the arrival time in Toronto, so he continued the flight as a matter of course, but did not Select Alternate for safety inspection. The captain's judgment was the reason why Air Canada Flight 797 suffered such heavy casualties.

最后，当飞机着陆机场后，机上的空中服务员迫不及待打开舱门，以输入清新空气。但这举动却也让机舱内的火灾接触到更多的空气，飞机内开始剧烈燃烧，而浓烟却没有因舱门打开而消散，部分乘客都因为机舱内能见度低而难以找到机门逃生。在不到90秒的时间内，飞机立即发生爆燃现象，把整个机舱完全吞噬，当时机上仍有23名乘客未及逃生。

Finally, when the plane landed at the airport, the flight attendant on board couldn't wait to open the door to let in fresh air. But this move also allowed the fire in the cabin to come into contact with more air, and the aircraft began to burn violently. However, the thick smoke did not dissipate when the cabin door was opened. Some passengers had difficulty finding the door to escape because of the low visibility in the cabin. In less than 90 seconds, the plane immediately exploded and completely engulfed the entire cabin. At that time, there were still 23 passengers on board who could not escape.

After this accident, the U.S. National Transportation Safety Board prescribed the following measures:

* Improve the escape routes and facilities on board so that even in a smoke-filled cabin, passengers can still follow clear escape instructions to escape the aircraft, including emergency track lighting on or near the floor, which is strong enough to block heavy fuel fire smoke
* It is mandatory to install smoke detectors on all civil aircraft, install automatic fire extinguishers near and inside toilet waste containers, use fire-resistant seat materials to limit the spread of fire and the production of toxic chemicals through ignition;
* Train flight attendants on contingency measures when dealing with similar incidents, such as teaching passengers to use emergency exits.

Regarding the captain's misjudgment in this case, the focus was more on the fire handling procedures than on the individual. For such a major risk as a fire on board an aircraft (if the fire cannot be controlled, the aircraft may crash and kill people within 8-10 minutes),  aircraft fire emergency response procedures clearly require that the crew must land the aircraft within 10-25 minutes.



Improvements made in this incident became industry-wide standards, and regulations on evacuation were updated: Aircraft manufacturers must demonstrate that their aircraft can complete evacuation within 90 seconds of initiating an evacuation.



When improving quality, we don’t put too much emphasis on individuals, but focus on procedures and technology to identify implementable improvement measures.
