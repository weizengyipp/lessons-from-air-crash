# 12 Not to replace lock parts in time

United Airlines Flight 811 was a scheduled international flight from Los Angeles to Sydney with stops in Honolulu and Auckland.

On February 24, 1989, the flight was operated by a Boeing 747-122 aircraft. Shortly after leaving Honolulu, the cargo door malfunctioned and automatically unlocked the door. The resulting explosive decompression caused several rows of seats to explode, 9 passengers died. The plane then returned to Honolulu and landed safely.

The incident focused on the outward-opening cargo door design used on the Boeing 747. Outward-opening cargo doors increase the aircraft's usable capacity, but require a strong locking mechanism to keep the doors closed due to pressure differences between the inside and outside of the aircraft during flight.



An aluminum component is used in the locking mechanism of the Boeing 747 cargo door to keep the door valve locked. But as early as 1975, 14 years before the accident, Boeing realized that the aluminum locking parts were too thin and could easily deform and break, causing the valves to loosen and rotate, and recommended that airlines add reinforcements to the locking parts.

After another Pan Am accident caused by the same fault in 1987, two years before the accident, Boeing issued another service bulletin telling operators to replace the aluminum locking pieces with steel ones.



The Federal Aviation Administration passed an airworthiness directive in July 1988, half a year before the accident, mandating parts replacement and giving American Airlines 18 to 24 months to complete the replacement. After the Flight 811 accident, the Federal Aviation Administration shortened the period to 30 days.



Another concern in this case is that the aircraft's forward cargo door had experienced intermittent malfunctions in the months before the accident. Based on this information and a presumption of in-use damage, these failures damaged the cargo door locking mechanism, causing the cargo door to display a locked and locked indication without being fully locked

As aircraft are the infrastructure for airline operations, United Airlines failed to establish and implement a maintenance system for the aircraft. Routine maintenance and inspections were inappropriate. Not only did it fail to replace unreliable aluminum parts in a timely manner, it also failed to detect damage to the locking device.



If an enterprise wants to continue operating and have a long-lasting foundation, it should implement risk prevention and response measures, especially for bottom-line risks. Strengthening team risk awareness and implementing risk measures are the responsibilities of senior leaders to the enterprise.
