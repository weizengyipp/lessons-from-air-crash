# 10 Aging aircraft

Aloha Airlines Flight 243 is a scheduled flight between Hawaii and Honolulu.

On April 28, 1988, the Boeing 737-297 suffered serious damage after an explosive decompression occurred during the flight. A flight attendant was ejected from the aircraft and died, and 65 other passengers and crew members were injured. Lucky What's more, the plane finally landed safely.



The direct cause of the accident is metal fatigue caused by oxidation of cracks in the body: the adhesives between metal parts of the body lose their effectiveness, and water molecules containing salt can enter the gaps in the body, and then begin to oxidize, causing the rivets that fix different metal parts to bear additional pressure. This is a known unavoidable problem during aircraft manufacturing, and maintenance and disaster prevention design are required to avoid accidents.



The key factor in the accident in this case was the age of the aircraft - at that time, the aircraft had been in use for 19 years, with a total number of flights (takeoff and landing cycles) of 89,090, exceeding the design expected cycle life of 75,000 takeoffs and landings. In fact, most of the same aircraft of this model airliner only served about 40,000 times before being retired.



The 737 has a mesh-like controllable fuselage rupture zone design inside the fuselage. The purpose is to at least control the rupture range and keep the fuselage intact when the aircraft unfortunately ruptures. However, the aircraft was already very old at the time. The upper fuselage was corroded, which increased the pressure on the rivets to an unbearable level. After the first control area was damaged, it caused even wider damage.

According to an official report from the National Transportation Safety Board, a passenger noticed a crack in the fuselage while boarding the plane and believed it could be a hazard, but did not tell anyone.



The crack is located near the boarding gate. This crack is likely to be the metal fatigue caused by the aircraft's 89,090 take-off and landing cycles. Because the aircraft flew short-haul routes, with multiple round-trips a day, and the 737 in the world at that time was, among passenger aircraft, this aircraft ranks second in terms of number of flights, and the first is also an aircraft operated by Aloha Air.



The accident report also noted that airlines schedule fuselage inspections at night, making it more difficult to adequately inspect the aircraft's fuselage.



After this case occurred, all major U.S. airlines decided to retire old passenger aircraft and must undergo additional maintenance and inspection procedures after a certain age to prevent a recurrence of the incident.



In fact, in civil aviation, the age of aircraft is not a key factor causing accidents. The reason is that maintenance inspection procedures can ensure that the aircraft's software and hardware are upgraded. So rather, "aging" was the key factor in this accident. Research shows that 89% of aircraft parts can only be discovered and repaired if they malfunction (this is the so-called unplanned maintenance). Therefore, disaster-proof design of components and maintenance according to procedures are effective ways to prevent accidents caused by aging.
