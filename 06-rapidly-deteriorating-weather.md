# 06 Rapidly deteriorating weather

Delta Flight 191 is a scheduled domestic flight by Delta Air Lines from Fort Lauderdale, Florida to Los Angeles with a stop at Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport (DFW).

On August 2, 1985, a Lockheed L-1011 Tristar aircraft carrying out Flight 191 encountered a microburst while landing at DFW. The plane crashed a mile (1.6 kilometers) short of the runway, killing 137 people and injuring 25 others in the crash.

The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) determined that the cause of the crash was the crew's incorrect decision to fly through a thunderstorm, a lack of procedures and training to avoid or escape from microbursts, and a lack of hazard information about wind shear.



The first focus of this case is the microburst.



Microburst , also known as microburst airflow, microdowndraft, is a local rapid downdraft. After the airflow reaches the ground, it will produce a tornado with destructive power. Straight-line winds spread in all directions, and their suddenness and power can pose a major danger to aircraft, especially aircraft taking off and landing at low altitudes.

According to the investigation data of this case, the storm formed near the airport that day was quite fast. After a Learjet that landed one minute earlier than Flight 191 arrived at the airport, the crew of Flight 191 thought that since small business jets If it can land, their passenger plane can of course land safely. But in fact, the microburst quickly formed within 1 minute after the small business jet landed, and even ground radar failed to detect this change. By the time the crew discovered that the weather conditions were worse than imagined, it was already too late.



Switching to the perspective of the crew, the passenger plane had begun to perform the approach procedure and had been landing along the set route. Although the airport is in a thunderstorm area, another heavy rain area has also formed near the airport, and it is impossible to go around and switch to the landing channel. In addition, it is known that a small business plane can land without receiving a danger warning (the radar equipment on the plane at the time can only detect thunderstorms, not wind changes), itâ€™s not surprising that the crew made the decision to fly through the thunderstorm. Since then, all U.S. commercial airliners have been required to install onboard windshear detection and warning systems.



What I want to remind you here is that when considering risks, you need to consider the speed at which risks change. For example, in aviation, in addition to weather, fire is a risk that changes very quickly. It is estimated that within 8-10 minutes, a small fire may turn into a disaster that destroys the aircraft and kills everyone. Underestimating risks usually means underestimating the speed of changes in risks, "I didn't expect it to be like this."



Another concern raised in this case is rescue notification.



The airport's security began notifying off-site emergency services nearly 10 minutes after the incident, and the notification was completed 45 minutes after the incident, without requesting assistance from other surrounding cities. The U.S. National Transportation Safety Board also criticized this.



After this case, the airport introduced an automatic voice notification system to reduce notification time. In another incident in 1988, Airport Security notified nearby emergency services in 21 minutes, more than twenty minutes faster than before, a good improvement. The National Transportation Safety Board issued a safety advisory on January 9, 1990, calling on airport managers nationwide to consider using automated voice notification systems for emergency assistance notifications.



Finally, incidentally, the animation of a computer-simulated flight was used as substantive evidence for the first time in the legal trial of this case, which cost approximately $100,000 to $150,000 at the time.
