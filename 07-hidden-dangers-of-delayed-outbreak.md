# 07 Hidden dangers of delayed outbreak

Japan Airlines Flight 123 is a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Tokyo to Osaka.

On August 12, 1985, a Boeing 747 flying this route exploded due to metal fatigue after 12 minutes of flight. The tail end of the 747 exploded due to metal fatigue, which also damaged the tail wing and hydraulic system. After flying for 32 minutes with minimal control, it finally crashed. In the Takamagahara Mountains area 100 kilometers away from Tokyo. The aircraft used a high-density seating configuration and carried a total of 524 people (509 passengers and 15 crew members). 520 people were killed. The accident was the deadliest in history involving a single aircraft and the second-deadliest in aviation history.

This case first focuses on the direct cause of the accident, a maintenance operation that violated procedures 7 years ago.



On June 2, 1978, the aircraft was flying from Tokyo to Osaka. When landing, the tail of the aircraft touched the ground due to an excessive angle. After the tail was damaged, when Boeing replaced the damaged pressure wall panel, it should have used a whole joint plate to connect the two panels that needed to be connected, and fixed them with three rows of rivets. However, Boeing maintenance personnel used two discontinuous panels to joint plates, one with a row of rivets on it and the other with two rows of rivets. This maintenance method violated Boeing's maintenance procedures, significantly increasing the stress on the metal skin near the joint point, and reducing the resistance to metal fatigue by at least 70%. During the flight after the repair, the metal fatigue here continued to accumulate due to multiple pressurization and depressurization inside the cabin.

According to the calculations of accident investigators, the illegal repair could only withstand about 10,000 flights, and the aircraft was already on its 12,319th flight after repairs when it crashed. On the day of the accident, when the 747 aircraft climbed to an altitude of about 7,000 meters, the accumulated metal fatigue of the pressure wall panel reached its limit and could no longer withstand the air pressure difference and ruptured. As a result, an explosion decompressed the cabin, and high-pressure air rushed into the tail of the aircraft, blowing off the vertical tail and tearing off the main hydraulic lines, causing the pilot to be unable to control the aircraft normally.



This is what needs to be pointed out in this case. The cause of the accident was laid as early as seven years ago, but it was only delayed until this time. Don't take chances. Any improper practices, illegal operations, or failure to follow the standards may not necessarily cause an accident immediately, but the accident will definitely come.



To add a similar example, China Airlines Flight 611 (operated by a Boeing 747) crashed on May 25, 2002. All 225 people on board were killed. This accident is still the deadliest accident in Taiwan. The reason is that it was not far away from the accident. In a maintenance operation 22 years ago, the maintenance personnel violated the requirements of Boeing's maintenance manual and did not replace the worn tail parts as a whole. Instead, they only added fixings to the worn parts, causing the wear cracks to spread over time and eventually the aircraft It disintegrated into four pieces in the air and was unable to even send out a distress signal.



The second concern in this case is the slow response to rescue.



Twenty minutes after the accident, the U.S. military stationed in Yokota detected the plane's distress signal. It was still daytime and dispatched a helicopter to discover the crash site and called the Japanese government to inquire whether assistance was needed. Yokota Air Force personnel have been on standby, but have not received a call from the Japanese government.



It was not until nightfall that a Japanese JSDF helicopter discovered the wreckage. Poor visibility and rugged mountainous terrain made it impossible to land at the site. Pilots reported from the air that there was no sign of survivors. According to reports, Japanese Self-Defense Force ground personnel did not go to the scene on the night of the crash. Instead, they were sent to spend the night in a makeshift village 63 kilometers from the crash site, setting up tents, building helicopter landing ramps and making other preparations. The rescue team set out for the scene the next morning, 17 hours after the accident. Medical staff later examined the bodies and found that many people had survived the crash but died of shock. If they could have rescued them sooner, fatal injuries would not have occurred.



The third focus of this case is the subsequent impact of the accident



The first is for Boeing, whose reputation has been affected due to improper maintenance that caused the crash. However, because the investigation results showed that the Boeing 747 had no major design flaws, the model was still selling well. In order to prevent the failure of all hydraulic controls on the Boeing 747 due to pipeline damage, the elevators and lower rudders on each 747 passenger aircraft were subsequently added. Hydraulic valve installed.



Secondly, for the Japanese aviation industry, the air crash severely damaged the Japanese people's confidence in their own airlines, and the number of passengers on domestic routes dropped by one-third. The Gunma Prefecture police transferred a total of 20 people related to JAL and Boeing to the Maebashi District Prosecutor's Office for investigation on charges of business negligence resulting in death, but in the end they were all dismissed without prosecution. The Chairman of JAL, the manager of the company's maintenance department, and several junior employees resigned due to the accident, and a JAL engineer even committed suicide to apologize. Although from public information, they are not directly related to the cause of the accident. However, at that time, there were widespread rumors in Japanese society that Boeing was taking the blame for JAL, which led to a sharp drop in JAL's booking rate. It was not until many years later that JAL recovered from this blow.



This air crash prompted the aviation industry to begin studying contingency measures in the event of hydraulic control failure. The crew of the Sioux City air crash in 1989 successfully brought the plane back to the airport based on the lessons learned after the crash. Although the plane still capsized due to a failed emergency landing, more than half of the crew survived, becoming the world's first large aircraft to fly without hydraulic control. A case of safe landing. But after reconstructing the accident using a flight simulator, investigators concluded that there were so many factors involved in this type of failure that, while a degree of control was possible, it was not possible to achieve a minimum degree of accuracy and, therefore, a safe landing in an uncontrolled aircraft condition was impossible. It is currently impossible for humans to achieve. The case is also considered a "highly random event."
