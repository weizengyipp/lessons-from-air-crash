On August 31, 1986, a McDonnell Douglas DC-9-32 passenger jet operating the flight collided with a small Piper PA-28-181 Cherokee private jet in mid-air as it was preparing to land at Los Angeles International Airport, resulting in two Both planes crashed in a residential area on the outskirts of Los Angeles.

All 64 people on the DC-9-32 passenger plane and 3 people on the PA-28-181 small private plane were killed. 15 people were killed and 8 injured in residential areas on the ground.

Since there were no survivors in the accident, the investigation focused on the air traffic controller who was on duty that day. Investigators found that the air traffic controller did not notice the appearance of PA-28-181 on the radar because he was focused on dealing with another small aircraft that accidentally entered the airspace without authorization.



However, it was a clear day with a wide field of vision. Why didn't the crews of the two planes notice each other?



A reasonable guess is that Flight 498 did not notice PA-28-181 because it was so small and difficult to detect coming from a distance. The pilot and family of PA-28-181 were not familiar with Los Angeles and needed to use ground roads as a guide. Therefore, investigators believed that they lost their sense of direction at the time, so they concentrated on the ground road environment and did not notice the approaching Flight 498 aircraft from the right..



In the end, the court evidence pointed out that the PA-28-181 pilot's error was the main cause of the crash. In addition, another small plane that broke into without permission was also heavily fined for indirectly causing the air crash.



From the above situation, who is to be blamed does not make much sense in terms of improving safety.

此案过后，美国联邦航空局要求美国空域内的所有大型商用喷气机（30人座以上的客机）配备交通碰撞避免系统（TCAS），并要求在密集空域运行的轻型飞机配备可以报告其高度的C型应答器。

After this case, the FAA required all large commercial jets (passenger aircraft with more than 30 seats) in U.S. airspace to be equipped with a Traffic Collision Avoidance System (TCAS), and required light aircraft operating in dense airspace to be equipped with Type C transponder that can report their altitude.&#x20;



The traffic collision avoidance system determines the aircraft's heading and altitude through the transponder on the aircraft (so the transponder must be present and turned on). When an aircraft is detected approaching, it will warn the pilot 40 seconds in advance of the other aircraft. At the same time, the other party's air collision avoidance system will issue the opposite warning to prevent aircraft from colliding with each other in the air. It is also known as the last line of defense for air collision avoidance.



Where people fail, new technologies are introduced to supplement them. But relying on technology does not mean everything will be fine.



Just in 2002, two planes were approaching each other in the sky over Überlingen in southern Germany. Both planes received warnings from the traffic collision avoidance system, but one plane did not obey the instructions of the collision avoidance system and instead obeyed the control. The pilot's instructions caused the two planes to collide in the air, causing serious casualties. In the 2006 Gol Airlines Flight 1907 crash, two aircraft with traffic collision avoidance systems collided in the air. The captain mistakenly turned off the transponder, disabling the air collision avoidance system and preventing the two aircraft from detecting each other. causing a collision.



Therefore, technology and people need to be viewed and improved from the perspective of dialectical unity and coordination, and they must not be partial or paranoid.
